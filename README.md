# DataStructures
This is a comprehensive list of all of the coursework I completed while taking the upper division CS course, Data Structures and Algorithms. 
These problems were done as groupwork. All problems were done using C#. 

Data Structures cover quicksort, linked lists, binary search tress, etc.
